# Pack Christmas Project 2022

We bring you another Christmas project from the SUSE Packaging team. This year, it has two parts. First, you can enjoy our Christmas card built from letters created by team members across the World. Then you can check a special packxmas package coming from Daniel Garcia.

We wish you a happy holidays season and have a lot of fun!

Your Packaging Team
